OPI screens for CSS BOY

Note that you'll either have to:
1. Edit the macros on the display and set Sys and Dev to appropriate values for the IOC
   or
2. Make a new screen (with e.g. a menu button) that loads smarpod.opi and sets the same macros.

The default settings, which should be changed, are listed in st.cmd:

    epicsEnvSet("SYS"                    , "XF:03IDC-ES")
    epicsEnvSet("CT_SYS"                 , "XF:03IDC-CT")
    epicsEnvSet("DEV"                    , "SPod:1")
